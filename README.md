# UC2: Feet and Inches Measurement Equality

## About :
This use case extends UC1 by adding equality comparison for measurements expressed in **inches** along with **feet**.

Both units are handled separately and compared within their own type.

## Objective
To verify equality of measurements in:
- feet
- inches

## How It Works
1. Two values in feet are compared using the `Feet` class.
2. Two values in inches are compared using the `Inches` class.
3. Each class overrides the `equals()` method.
4. The result is returned as **true** or **false**.

## Example

Input:
1.0 ft and 1.0 ft  
1.0 inch and 1.0 inch  

Output:
Equal (true)  
Equal (true)

## Implementation Highlights
- Separate `Feet` and `Inches` classes.
- Each class stores value as `private final double`.
- Overrides `equals()` for value-based comparison.
- Uses `Double.compare()` for accurate floating-point comparison.
- Includes null and type safety checks.
- Equality checks are handled through helper methods.

## Sample Test Cases
- Same feet values → equal  
- Different feet values → not equal  
- Same inches values → equal  
- Different inches values → not equal  
- Comparison with null → false  
- Same reference → true  

## Concepts Learned
- Object equality
- Floating-point comparison
- Encapsulation & immutability
- Null & type safety
- Code reuse through helper methods

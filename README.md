# UC9: Weight Measurement Support

## Overview
This use case adds support for **weight measurements** to the application.

The system can now compare, convert, and add weight values just like length measurements.

---

## Supported Units
- KILOGRAM (base unit)
- GRAM
- POUND

---

## Conversion Rules
- 1 kilogram = 1000 grams  
- 1 pound ≈ 0.453592 kilograms  

---

### Equality
Weight values are converted to kilograms before comparison.

Example:
1 kg equals 1000 g → true

---

### Conversion
Weight values can be converted between units.

Example:
1 kg → grams = 1000 g  
2 lb → kg ≈ 0.91 kg  

---

### Addition
Two weights can be added together.

Default result → unit of first value  
Optional → specify target unit  

Examples:

1 kg + 1000 g → 2 kg  
500 g + 0.5 kg → 1000 g  
1 lb + 453.592 g → ≈ 2 lb  

---

## Important Note
- Weight and length are separate categories.
- 1 kg is NOT equal to 1 foot.

---

## Concepts Used
- Multiple measurement categories
- Base unit conversion
- Enum-based design
- Arithmetic operations
- Type safety

---

## Improvement Over UC8
UC8 improved design for length units.  
UC9 proves the design works for new categories like weight.

# UC3: Generic Quantity Class (DRY Principle)

## About :
This use case refactors the separate Feet and Inches classes into a single generic **Length** class.

It removes code duplication and allows comparison between different units by converting them into a common base unit.

## Objective
To compare measurements across different units while following the **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principle.

## How It Works
1. A `Length` object stores a value and its unit.
2. Supported units are defined using a `LengthUnit` enum.
3. Values are converted to a common base unit (feet).
4. The overridden `equals()` method compares the converted values.
5. The result is returned as **true** or **false**.

## Example

Input:
Quantity(1.0, FEET) and Quantity(12.0, INCH)

Output:
Equal (true)

## Implementation Highlights
- Single `Length` class handles all units.
- `LengthUnit` enum stores conversion factors.
- Converts values to a base unit before comparison.
- Eliminates duplicate code from UC1 and UC2.
- Uses `Double.compare()` for accurate comparison.
- Includes null and type safety checks.

## Sample Test Cases
- 1 ft == 1 ft → equal  
- 1 inch == 1 inch → equal  
- 1 ft == 12 inch → equal  
- 1 ft != 2 ft → not equal  
- Invalid unit → rejected  
- Comparison with null → false  

## Concepts Learned
- DRY principle (removing duplicate code)
- Enum usage for unit management
- Abstraction and encapsulation
- Cross-unit conversion
- Value-based equality
- Sca lable and maintainable design

## Improvement Over UC1 & UC2
- Removes duplicate Feet & Inches classes
- Supports cross-unit comparison
- Easier to add new units
- Cleaner and more maintainable code

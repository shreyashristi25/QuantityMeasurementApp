# UC10: Generic Quantity Class Using IMeasurable

## About : 
UC10 refactors the application design by introducing a single generic class:

Quantity<U>

This replaces separate classes like QuantityLength and QuantityWeight.

The new design removes code duplication and allows the system to support any measurement category using a common interface.

---

## Key Improvements
- Introduces a generic Quantity<U> class
- Uses a common IMeasurable interface for all unit types
- Removes duplicate QuantityLength and QuantityWeight classes
- Simplifies application structure
- Makes the system scalable for new measurement categories

---

## How It Works

### Generic Quantity Class
The Quantity class now works with any unit type that implements IMeasurable.

Examples:
- LengthUnit
- WeightUnit
- (Future) VolumeUnit
- (Future) TemperatureUnit

### IMeasurable Interface
All unit enums implement IMeasurable.

Responsibilities:
- Convert value to base unit
- Convert value from base unit

This allows Quantity to work with any measurement category.

---

## Supported Features
All functionality from UC1–UC9 continues to work:

✔ Equality comparison  
✔ Unit conversion  
✔ Addition of quantities  
✔ Cross-unit arithmetic  
✔ Base unit normalization  

## Example Usage

Equality:
1 foot == 12 inches → true  

Conversion:
1 yard → 3 feet  

Addition:
1 foot + 12 inches = 2 feet  

Weight:
1000 grams = 1 kilogram

## Architecture Benefits

### No Code Duplication
One Quantity class replaces multiple category-specific classes.

### Scalable Design
New measurement categories can be added without modifying existing code.

### Single Responsibility Principle
- Units handle conversion logic.
- Quantity handles comparison and arithmetic.

### Open–Closed Principle
System is open for extension but closed for modification.

---

## Rules
- Operations are allowed only within the same measurement category.
- Units must implement IMeasurable.
- Cross-category comparisons are not allowed.

---

## Concepts Used
- Generics in Java
- Interface-based design
- Code reuse and abstraction
- Open–Closed Principle
- Single Responsibility Principle

---

## Improvement Over UC9
UC9 introduced multiple quantity classes for different categories.

UC10 replaces them with a single generic design, improving scalability and maintainability.

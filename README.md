# UC12: Subtraction and Division Operations

## About : 
This use case adds **subtraction** and **division** operations to quantity measurements.

The system can now compute differences and ratios between measurements while keeping the generic design intact.

## Supported Categories
- Length
- Weight
- Volume

## How It Works

### Subtraction
Subtracts one quantity from another within the same category.

✔ Units may differ  
✔ Result defaults to the unit of the first value  
✔ Target unit can be specified  

Examples:

5 ft − 12 in → 4 ft  
2 L − 500 mL → 1.5 L  
10 kg − 250 g → 9.75 kg  

### Division
Divides one quantity by another to produce a **dimensionless ratio**.

✔ Units may differ  
✔ Both values must belong to the same category  

Examples:

10 ft ÷ 5 ft → 2  
1000 mL ÷ 1 L → 1  
2 kg ÷ 500 g → 4

## Rules
- Both quantities must belong to the same category.
- Different units are automatically converted.
- Division by zero throws an error.
- Original objects remain unchanged.

---

## Concepts Used
- Generic arithmetic operations
- Base unit normalization
- Unit conversion reuse
- Dimensionless ratios
- Error handling and validation

---

## Improvement Over UC11
UC11 supported equality, conversion, and addition.

UC12 completes arithmetic support by adding subtraction and division.

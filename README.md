# 🚀 Quantity Measurement App 

- Conversion between different units (e.g., cm ↔ m, kg ↔ g)  
- Comparison of quantities across units  
- Arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction of quantities  
- Handling of multiple measurement domains such as:
  - Length  
  - Weight  
  - Volume  
  - Temperature  

This ensures **accuracy, consistency, and flexibility** in handling real-world measurement problems.
---

This repository contains the Spring Boot backend for the Quantity Measurement Application.
The application is designed to perform **accurate unit measurement conversions and arithmetic operations on quantities** such as length, weight, volume, and temperature.  
It also integrates a **secure authentication system using Spring Security, JWT, and Google OAuth2** to ensure safe and scalable user access.

## 🔄 Authentication Flow

### 🔑 JWT Authentication Flow
- User sends login request  
- Backend validates credentials  
- JWT token is generated  
- Token is sent to client  
- Client includes token in headers for API requests  
- Backend validates token for each request  

### 🌍 Google OAuth2 Flow
- User clicks "Login with Google"  
- Redirect to Google Authentication page  
- Google verifies user credentials  
- Backend receives user details  
- User is registered (if new)  
- JWT token is generated and returned  

---

## 📊 Advantages  

- 🔐 High security (OAuth2 + JWT)  
- ⚡ Scalable (stateless backend)  
- 🧩 Clean and maintainable architecture  
- 🔄 Easy integration with frontend applications  
- 👨‍💻 Reduced backend complexity  

---

## 📌 Conclusion  

This project implements a **modern backend system** with:

- **Robust quantity measurement and conversion logic**

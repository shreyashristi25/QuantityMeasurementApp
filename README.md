# UC1: Feet Measurement Equality
## About :
This use case compares two measurements expressed in feet and checks whether they are equal.

## Objective
To determine if two numeric values in feet represent the same measurement.

## How It Works
1. Two values in feet are provided.
2. A `Feet` object is created for each value.
3. The overridden `equals()` method compares the values.
4. The result is returned as **true** or **false**.

## Example

Input:
1.0 ft and 1.0 ft

Output:
Equal (true)

## Implementation Highlights
- Uses a `Feet` class to represent measurement.
- Stores value as `private final double` (immutable).
- Overrides `equals()` for value-based comparison.
- Uses `Double.compare()` for accurate floating-point comparison.
- Includes null and type safety checks.

## Sample Test Cases
- Same values → equal  
- Different values → not equal  
- Comparison with null → false  
- Same reference → true  

## Concepts Learned
- Object equality
- Floating-point comparison
- Encapsulation & immutability
- Null & type safety

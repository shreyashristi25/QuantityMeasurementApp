# UC5: Unit-to-Unit Conversion (Same Measurement Type)

## About :
This use case extends UC4 by adding **explicit unit conversion** functionality.

The application can now convert a measurement from one unit to another instead of only checking equality.

## Objective
To convert length values between supported units:

- feet
- inches
- yards
- centimeters

## How It Works
1. The `convert()` method accepts:
   - numeric value
   - source unit
   - target unit
2. The value is validated (must be finite and units must be valid).
3. The value is converted to a common base unit.
4. The base value is converted to the target unit.
5. The converted numeric value is returned.

### Supported Units
- Feet
- Inches
- Yards
- Centimeters

### Conversion Formula
result = value × (sourceUnit.factor / targetUnit.factor)

### Examples
1 ft → inches → 12  
3 yards → feet → 9  
2.54 cm → inches → ~1  

### Concepts
- Base unit normalization
- Mathematical conversion logic
- Input validation
- Floating-point accuracy
